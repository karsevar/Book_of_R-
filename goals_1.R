#Mason never forget that everyone wants something from you. It's your duty to go about your business without conforming to the other's expectations. You have been living your life according to false ideals (or rather the ideals of a third parties self interest). Do not look towards approval from your peers (you will never find it for everyone is obsessed about their own self interest). Your job right now is to create your own self interest and create a goal out of it. 
#The main question is what is your goal?:
	#my goal is to learning everything about R and computing in general.
		#(question): The problem about this goal is is it sustainable?
		# No it isn't and I'm sad to say that people don't believe in the ideal of mastering subjects. All they believe in is the profit margin (and a very distorted variation at that since they believe that objects in the modern economy).
		#In addition this goal will never end and to be honest americans aren't that intelligent about findiing people who actual know what they are doing.
		# solution to this problem: learn R to a reasonable degree that I find a job. 
		#problem when will that moment occur? How will I know for a fact that I am ready for a job in computing and programming? what are the skills required to hold these positions? 
		# In all honesty I don't know that ansewer. I believe that people are going towards machine learning. But I don't know what field in this all encompassing subject they are moving towards.
			#response: perhaps an intelligent move is to ask around. Learning the industry through meet ups. Learn if this is the right choice for you. 
			#comment: this is the right choice for me. I tried out teaching and being a lackey for some small school district. Such a future is not what I had in mind. I need something more challenging and to be honest I need something that is more complicate since I'm a bad minial laborer. Programming is most likely the only place I can exist in. 
			#response: good to hear that so I guess that you have only computer science to look towards. What subject have you been studying?
			#comment: I have been studying R programming and statistics.
			#response: what are you planning to do with such a combination?
			#comment: the world is moving towards machine learning and statistical analysis and I felt it prudent to learn about these subjects as a means to prepare myself for the future.
			#response: What will the future entale?
			#comment: Only dystopia. The social media and the constant consumption of advertisements will only lead towards a world where people are controlled by statistical algorithms that categorize them and dictate where they are bound to go in life by some flawed monte carlo formula.
			#response: what have you done to prepare yourself for such a future?
			#comment: I read book of r and am reading r for data science. I have read a number of stock market and ecomonics books but they have never told me anything.
			#response: it seems that you need to read more. What is your current study regiment?
			#comment: My current study regiment is a chapter a day from the book of R.
			#response: that isn't enough. You will need to do more studying and read more books in a single day to accomplish the same things as a student enrolled in a university.
